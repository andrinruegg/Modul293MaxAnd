# Project Description
In this project, we are creating an online shop as a website called "Deluxe Drives". In our online shop we sell luxus cars. We create 5 pages, a homepage with an introduction of our website. A rent page, where every car available is displayed. A detailed page, where the details of one car is displayed as soon as you click on one on the rent page. An about us page in which we are presented. And a login page for the user.

# Information
## Folder structure
The html, css and other files are all outside of folders because we are using Vercel to automate our website.
Since Vercel doesn't recognise the html files in a folder we had to put them all outside. With that our github is a mess but our website is online an automated and that's all we need.



## Optimization
To optimize our website you can use the build.js file and run it in your terminal with "node build.js".

If you do that a folder named "dist" will be created and in there are the optimized .html and .css files.

With that you can continue to use our website in an optimized way.
